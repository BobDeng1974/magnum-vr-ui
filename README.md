Magnum VR UI
============

*Magnum::Ui + Leap Motion + Oculus Rift VR*

![magnum-vr-ui.gif](img/magnum-vr-ui.gif)

Mix of [Magnum Ui Gallery](http://magnum.graphics/showcase/magnum-ui-gallery/),
[Magnum Oculus VR example](http://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/examples-ovr.html) and
[Magnum Leap Motion example](http://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/examples-leapmotion.html),
showing how to fusion them all together.

As the intersection of platforms supported by both Leap Motion and Oculus is Windows, only
Windows is supported.

# Building

You may be better off just downloading a build from [releases](https://github.com/Squareys/magnum-vr-ui/releases) instead.
But if you insist:

The project relies on [CMake](https://cmake.org/). You can use [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) or
[build Corrade, Magnum, MagnumIntegration and MagnumExtras yourself](http://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/building.html).
After that, building this project should be a matter of:

~~~
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --target install
~~~

Potentially with additional parameters like `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` or
`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` depending on your specific setup.
